Based on Annual Revenue of $100 million or higher according to the Business Journal. If the Annual Revenue of the Company does not reach the aforementioned threshold value, the membership dues are 50% less. For startup companies that are interested to join MO-CCI, and whose Annual Revenue is less than $5 million, the Consortium Director may accommodate that portion of the $12,500 membership fees be in the form of an in-kind contribution - like software for student usage – that is essential for MO-CCI’s operations, if and when applicable.
