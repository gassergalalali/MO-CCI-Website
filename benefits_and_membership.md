        <h1>Membership Fees</h1>
        <p>The annual membership fee for MO-CCI is $25,000. THis is based on annual revenue of $100 million or higher according to the Business Journal. If the Annual Revenue of the Company does not reach the aforementioned threshold value, the membership dues are 50% less.</p>

        <p>For startup companies that are interested to join MO-CCI, and whose Annual Revenue is less than $5 million, the Consortium Director may accommodate that portion of the $12,500 membership fees be in the form of an in-kind contribution - like software for student usage – that is essential for MO-CCI’s operations, if and when applicable.</p>
