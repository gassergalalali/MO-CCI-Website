Core Areas, Composition, and Dissemination
The objectives of MO-CCI are realized through the
following three core areas:

1. Student Development: Improve the quality of
educational preparation of students so as to better
serve industry needs by having graduates who can
hit the ground running as well as provide multiple
first-hand forums for member companies towards
evaluating and networking with current students.

2. Research: Conduct applied and practical research
tailored to the needs of the industry partners. This is
similar to the model of the Construction Industry
Institute (CII) but in a way more “personal” approach
that is tailored to the sole needs of Missouri’s
construction industry.

3. Professional Development: Enhance the skills of
industry personnel through continuing education
workshops that aims to promote efficiency and
prepare future company leaders.

As an industry-funded entity, MO-CCI will be composed
of both Contractor side (i.e. contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, ...) and Owner side in Missouri. As such, this
which will create an interactive forum to enhance
mutual collaboration on future projects.

MO-CCI will organize an Annual Conference to: (a) report
and disseminate results and findings related to all
activities in the prior year; (b) provide various seminars
by CEM academic and industry experts; and (3) develop
plans, strategies, and priorities for future activities. This
will provide continued loop for improved performance.
