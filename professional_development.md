### The Professional Development objective will be satisfied as follows:

- MO-CCI will offer workshops to satisfy
the yearly identified areas that will help mid-career
engineers at consortium member companies
develop their skills as they evolve as project
managers, top officials, and company leaders.

- The yearly needs of the member companies will be
identified using a survey. These
workshops will be open to all companies, and if
needed, they can be tailored to the employees of
one specific companies to satisfy any privacy or
proprietary needs for such company.

- It is expected that such workshops will be taught by
selected expert consultants nationwide with some
support from full time and adjunct faculty at MST.
Also, it is foreseen that registration fees for such
workshops will range from $500-$1,000 per person
depending on the topic. However, MO-CCI member
companies will get discounted off the normal rate
based  50% off,
with an additional 25% discount for group
registration of 5 or more.
