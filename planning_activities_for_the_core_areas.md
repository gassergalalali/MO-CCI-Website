### The Student Development is addressed as follows:

- MO-CCI will pro-actively help its industry partners
have an early on impact towards shaping the
qualities of MST graduates to hit the ground running
when joining their companies.

- Using yearly surveys (sample available), MO-CCI will
identify industry needs in their new hires to improve
associated curriculum at MST. Potential areas can
include: enhanced reading of drawings; better
understanding of specs; first-hand knowledge of
how designs (civil, electrical, and mechanical) are
actually constructed in the field; uses of visualization
techniques in construction; learning early-on about
the importance of flexibility towards travel and
relocation in the construction industry; and
improving different communication skills.

- Based on survey output, a committee will be formed
between the Platinum member companies to deliver
“Field Engineering” classes that are taught by their
own rising-star industry professionals both in Rolla
and remotely from Saint Louis.

- This effort will not only provide opportunity to
member companies to have proactive role in better
preparing students to hit the ground running when
they start their careers, but it will also help these
companies further develop the communication skills
of their star performing professionals who will be
chosen to deliver such classes. Thus, it represents an
optimal win/win situation for all stakeholders.

### The Research objective will be satisfied as follows:

- MO-CCI can fund - based on available monies - every
year one or two or even more applied research
topics with about 12 to 24 month study period
depending on the topic and the required output of
the industry partners.

- The list of potential research topics will be generated
annually based on an industry needs survey (sample
available) as well as suggestions from associated
faculty at MST

- Throughout the project duration, each funded team
will work closely with representatives from member
companies of MO-CCI to ensure alignment and
applicability of the research.

- In addition to providing a formal presentation during
the Annual Conference, each research team will
prepare a report including results, best practices,
and any developed tools that will be shared with all
industry partners.

- As MO-CCI advances in scope, expertise is expected
to be sought and expand the team through retaining
a retired, reputable industry expert with broad
expertise to serve as a full-time consultant. The hire
of such consultant will be based on a list of
acceptable professionals provided by consortium
member companies. This consultant will provide
quick-turn-around and best practices to identify,
avoid, and mitigate challenges in their ongoing and
future projects. Participation in this service will be at
the rate of $260 per hour. However, MO-CCI
member companies can just add $5,000 at the
beginning of the year for their annual membership
fees to cover up to 60 hours per year of consultancy
services for each member company (i.e. $100 per
hour), and each additional hour at 25% discount (i.e.
$195 per hour) for Gold Members and 50% discount
(i.e. $130 per hour) for Platinum members.

### The Professional Development objective will be satisfied as follows:

- MO-CCI will offer workshops on Saturdays to satisfy
the yearly identified areas that will help mid-career
engineers at consortium member companies
develop their skills as they evolve as project
managers, top officials, and company leaders.

- The yearly needs of the member companies will be
identified using a survey (sample available). These
workshops will be open to all companies, and if
needed, they can be tailored to the employees of
one specific companies to satisfy any privacy or
proprietary needs for such company.

- It is expected that such workshops will be taught by
selected expert consultants nationwide with some
support from full time and adjunct faculty at MST.
Also, it is foreseen that registration fees for such
workshops will range from $500-$1,000 per person
depending on the topic. However, MO-CCI member
companies will get discounted off the normal rate
based on the membership grade (i.e. 25% off for
Gold members and 50% off for Platinum members)
with an additional 25% discount for group
registration of 5 or more.
