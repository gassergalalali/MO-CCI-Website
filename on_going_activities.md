### The Student Development is addressed as follows:

- MO-CCI will pro-actively help its industry partners
have an early on impact towards shaping the
qualities of MST graduates to hit the ground running
when joining their companies.

- Using yearly surveys (sample available), MO-CCI will
identify industry needs in their new hires to improve
associated curriculum at MST. Potential areas can
include: enhanced reading of drawings; better
understanding of specs; first-hand knowledge of
how designs (civil, electrical, and mechanical) are
actually constructed in the field; uses of visualization
techniques in construction; learning early-on about
the importance of flexibility towards travel and
relocation in the construction industry; and
improving different communication skills.

- This effort will also help the member companies
companies further develop the communication skills
of their star performing professionals who will be
chosen to deliver such classes. Thus, it represents an
optimal win/win situation for all stakeholders.

### The Research objective will be satisfied as follows:

- MO-CCI will fund every
year one or two or even more applied research
topics with about 12 to 24 month study period
depending on the topic and the required output of
the industry partners.

- The list of potential research topics will be generated
annually based on an industry needs survey
as well as suggestions from associated faculty at Missouri S&T

- Throughout the project duration, each funded team
will work closely with representatives from member
companies of MO-CCI to ensure alignment and
applicability of the research.

- In addition to providing a formal presentation during
the Annual Conference, each research team will
prepare a report including results, best practices,
and any developed tools that will be shared with all
industry partners.

### The Professional Development objective will be satisfied as follows:

- MO-CCI will offer workshops to satisfy
the yearly identified areas that will help mid-career
engineers at consortium member companies
develop their skills as they evolve as project
managers, top officials, and company leaders.

- The yearly needs of the member companies will be
identified using a survey. These
workshops will be open to all companies, and if
needed, they can be tailored to the employees of
one specific companies to satisfy any privacy or
proprietary needs for such company.

- It is expected that such workshops will be taught by
selected expert consultants nationwide with some
support from full time and adjunct faculty at MST.
Also, it is foreseen that registration fees for such
workshops will range from $500-$1,000 per person
depending on the topic. However, MO-CCI member
companies will get discounted off the normal rate
based  50% off,
with an additional 25% discount for group
registration of 5 or more.
