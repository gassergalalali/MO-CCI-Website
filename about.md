                    As an industry-funded entity, MO-CCI will be composed of both the contractor side (i.e. contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, etc) and the owner side in Missouri. As such, this which will create an interactive forum to enhance mutual collaboration on future projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MO-CCI will organize an Annual Conference to: (a) report and disseminate results and findings related to all activities in the prior year; (b) provide various seminars
                    by CEM academic and industry experts; and (3) develop plans, strategies, and priorities for future activities. This will provide continued loop for improved performance.
