                <p>
                The Missouri Consortium for Construction Innovation (MO-CCI) is a partnership between academia and industry that aims at optimizing corporate performance and project lifecycle through an integrated construction engineering and management (CEM) vision directed at student development research, and professional development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objectives of MO-CCI are realized through the following three core areas:

                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="{{ '/student_development.html' | relative_url }}"><b>Student Development</b></a>: Improve the quality of educational preparation of students so as to better serve industry needs by having graduates who can hit the ground running as well as provide multiple first-hand forums for member companies towards  evaluating and networking with current students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="{{ '/research_development.html' | relative_url }}"><b>Research Development</b></a>: Conduct applied and practical research tailored to the needs of the industry partners. This is similar to the model of the Construction Industry         Institute (CII) but in a way more “personal” approach that is tailored to the sole needs of Missouri’s construction industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="{{ '/professional_development.html' | relative_url }}"><b>Professional Development</b></a>: Enhance the skills of industry personnel through continuing education workshops that aims to promote efficiency and prepare future company leaders.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As an industry-funded entity, MO-CCI will be composed of both Contractor side (i.e. contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, ...) and Owner side in Missouri. As such, this which will create an interactive forum to enhance mutual collaboration on future projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MO-CCI will organize an Annual Conference to: (a) report and disseminate results and findings related to all activities in the prior year; (b) provide various seminars
                    by CEM academic and industry experts; and (3) develop plans, strategies, and priorities for future activities. This will provide continued loop for improved performance.
                </p>
